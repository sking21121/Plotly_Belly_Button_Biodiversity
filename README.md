# Plotly-Belly Button Biodiversity
Interactive dashboard available at https://sking21121.github.io/Plotly_Belly_Button_Biodiversity/

The purpose of this challenge was to complete the panel for demographic information and to visualize the
bacterial data for each volunteer.

Four technical analysis deliverables for Roza. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart, a Bubble Chart, a Gauge Chart,
and Customize the Dashboard. The bar chart should display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an
individualâ€™s ID is selected from the dropdown menu. At the same time a bubble chart will display OTU Ids 
and Sample values. And create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value as a measure
from 0 to 10.
