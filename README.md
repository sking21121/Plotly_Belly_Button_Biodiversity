# Plotly-Belly Button Biodiversity
Interactive dashboard available at https://sking21121.github.io/Plotly_Belly_Button_Biodiversity/
To complete the panel for demographic information and to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer.
Four technical analysis deliverables for Roza. Create a Horizontal Bar Chart, a Bubble Chart, a Gauge Chart,
and Customize the Dashboard. The bar chart should display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an
individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu. At the same time a bubble chart will display OTU Ids 
and Sample values. And create a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value as a measure
from 0 to 10.
